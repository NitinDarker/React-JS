# Tic-Tac-Toe (v2.0)

Update to the previous major React project: ***Tic-Tac-Toe***.\
Made with the help of a tutorial from [**React.dev**](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) website.

It implements a new mechanic to the game: **Time Travel**  
Now the players can use the *Time Machine* to go back to a previous state of the board. All the past moves are displayed at the right side of the board. Just clicking on them restores the board to a previous state.

Vite was used as a platform for this react app.

## Potential Future Updates:

- ~~Add a Time Travel Mechanic so that player can restore any previous state of the board.~~

- For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.

- Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.

- Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.

- When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).

- Ask for the names of the player before starting, rather than using conventional Player-1 & Player-2

- Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.

- Store the history of previous winners of the game in the current session
  
- Implement an option to increase the size of the board from a traditional 3x3 to a higher value
