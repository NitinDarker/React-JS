# Working Clock App

This is my first attempt at building a working clock app using **React**.

### Features of this digital clock:
* Updates every second in real-time.
* Dropdown menu to change text color.

### Things I've learned while building this app:
- `useState` hook in React.
- Working with multiple components in React.
- `Date()` JavaScript object to get the current time.
- `label` and `select` HTML elements for a dropdown menu.
- `onChange` handlers for `label`-`select` elements.

### What's Next?
- A start/stop toggle for the clock.
- Refactoring the component structure for better maintainability.
- Using other hooks like `useEffect` for improved efficiency and readability.
